The http_web file is a simple program that consumes a public API with the url
http://services.groupkt.com/country/get/all
The API is a free RESTful API to be used for testing and therefore does not require authentication.
The module urllib.request for python 3 is used to handle the API url.
The API responds with all countries with their codes which are displayed on the console formated by JSON's pprint.


HOW TO RUN
The script has been written using python 3 (hence the use of 'from urllib.request import urlopen' in the headers; in python 2 the statement would have been 'from urllib2 import urlopen' )
-save file
-ensure you have python 3 installed.
-open command window from the location of the file 
-run the file (ie $ python http_web.py)
